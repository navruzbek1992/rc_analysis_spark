# Reddit Comments analysis using spark

This repo shows how to download, process and make simple analysis of Reddit comments in databricks notebook environment.

## Getting Started

Here, I will use community edition of databricks which is very limited. Only 10GB of space and no workers are available.
That is why the data size that we use to analyze will be limited.

### Prerequisites

Ready databricks environment.

### Installing

All required libraries can be downloaded from inside of the notebook.
