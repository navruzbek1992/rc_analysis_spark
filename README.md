# Reddit Comments analysis

This repo shows how to download, process and run simple ML models of Reddit comments in databricks notebook environment using pyspark.

## Getting Started

Here, I will use community edition of databricks which is very limited. Only 10GB of space and no workers are available.
That is why the data size that we use to analyze will be limited.

### Prerequisites

Ready databricks environment.

### Installing

All required libraries can be downloaded from the notebook.
